> <em>Overhaul chat with proximity-based communication and an echolink item to connect with others on the same frequency. Stay in sync and strategize effortlessly.</em>

---
### Overview
Utilize Echolinks for discreet communication with friends sharing your frequency. The Echolink recipe is shapeless; arranging the ingredients in different sequences creates unique frequenciesâ€”so safeguard your recipe!

Local chat is enabled by default, with fully configurable ranges. As you distance yourself from others, their messages will naturally become less clear and harder to decipher.

<em>Everything is fully configurable and toggleable. Check the ``config.yml`` for details.</em>


### Recipe <em>(configurable)</em>

<br />
<em>Amethyst shard, lightning rod, echo shard, nautilus shell, block of copper, emerald, redstone dust, iron bars, redstone torch.</em>
<br />
<br />
This is a shapeless recipe but <b>the ingredient order determines the Echolink's channel frequency.</b>

Only Echolinks with the same frequency can communicate with each other <em>so protect your recipe order!</em>
